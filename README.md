Hi Humans!

Buggy here! I am a cat, a black cat, and I can bite your nose off if I want to...so don't think I am one of those cuddly cats that wants your snout in my tummy... I DON'T.                                                                                  

Just feed me, pat my head once or twice, and leave me alone!
Get out. Goodbye you strange-smelling human!
Bye for meow,
-Buggy
